Attention Shoppers!

Planning an audio vacation? Head over to our electronics department where you'll find everything you need for a great background music experience. Our cassettes come in a variety of themes that you're sure to love. We have everything from in-store advertisements to instrumental versions of 90's pop charts and more. And, it all comes at our low KMRT price!

The KMRT Radio App streams audio that actually played via cassette tapes in a major American department store during the Early 1990s. This app features a radio-style feeling, with countless hours of music, suited for any season of year. Just open the app and let it play. While listening, you cannot scrub the audio tracks, similar to the in-store experience. You can only jump around to different time eras to experience what they would have sounded like.

This app requires an internet connection to run. All Audio is sourced from and streams from the Internet Archive. No audio is stored in the application itself.
